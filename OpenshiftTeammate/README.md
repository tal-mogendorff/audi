```

## üìã Requirements

- OpenShift cluster with API access enabled
- OpenShift user credentials with appropriate permissions
- Kubiya platform access
- `KUBIYA_API_KEY` environment variable set

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Configure Variables**:
```hcl
module "openshift_proxy" {
  source = "kubiya-terraform/kubiya"

  # OpenShift Configuration
  openshift_url      = "https://openshift.example.com"
  openshift_username = "admin"
  openshift_password = var.openshift_password  # Pass securely

  # Runner Configuration
  kubiya_runner = "kubiya-hosted"
  
  # Access Control
  name = "openshift-expert"
  integrations = ["slack"]
  allowed_groups = ["Admins", "Users"]
}
```

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
```bash
export KUBIYA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

3. **Deploy**:
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## üí¨ Example Interactions

```
User: "Create a new project called my-app"
Assistant: "I'll help you create a new OpenShift project called my-app. Status: Creating..."

User: "Deploy an application from image"
Assistant: "I'll help you deploy an application. Please provide:
1. The image name
2. The target project
3. Optional: resource limits"

User: "List all projects"
Assistant: "Here are your OpenShift projects:
1. my-app
2. default
3. openshift-monitoring
..."
```

## üìù Configuration Reference

### Required Variables

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|------|-------------|------|---------|
| `openshift_url` | OpenShift cluster URL | `string` | - |
| `openshift_password` | OpenShift password | `string` | - |

### Optional Variables

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|------|-------------|------|---------|
| `openshift_username` | OpenShift username | `string` | `""` |

## üîí Security Features

1. **Credential Management**:
   - Secure storage in Kubiya's secret management
   - Environment variable-based configuration
   - Access control through Kubiya groups

2. **Access Controls**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Integration-specific permissions
   - Audit logging of all operations

3. **Operation Security**:
   - Resource quotas and limits
   - Namespace isolation
   - Controlled access to cluster resources

## üîç Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Connection Issues**:
   ```
   Error: Failed to connect to OpenShift cluster
   Solution: Verify OpenShift URL and credential permissions
   ```

2. **Authentication Errors**:
   ```
   Error: Invalid credentials
   Solution: Check OpenShift username and password configuration
   ```

3. **Resource Access Issues**:
   ```
   Error: Insufficient permissions
   Solution: Verify user roles and permissions in OpenShift
   ```
